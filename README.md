# Todo.txt Touch

An Android application by [Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org) and [the Todo.txt community](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/) designed to manage your [todo.txt file](http://todotxt.com) stored in [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) (and eventually, other configurable cloud sources).

[Download an alpha version of the apk](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-touch/downloads), but be aware this app is in development and there are several [known bugs and todo items](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-touch/issues). 

Right now, when you install the app, log into Dropbox and it creates a Dropbox/todo/todo.txt file. To get started, choose "Add Task" from the menu and add your todo item. If you've already got a todo.txt file, just copy and paste it into your Dropbox/todo/ folder, then choose "Sync" from the menu in the Android app to load your tasks.

When you edit, complete, prioritize, or delete a task, the app makes the changes to your todo.txt file and syncs those changes back to Dropbox. You can filter by project, context, or priority, search, and sort by todo ID, priority, or alphabetically.

Right now this is an experimental, educational undertaking, but we hope to submit Todo.txt Touch to the Android Market in the first quarter of 2011. There are already a multitude of decent task managers for Android, but it would be fun to do a little collaborative work and learn about Android development with a very basic app that does a very simple thing right now. 

Interested in joining in? Fork the project and talk to us on the [Todo.txt CLI mailing list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/).
